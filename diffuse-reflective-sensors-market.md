<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diffuse Reflective Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Diffuse Sensors</li><li>Diffuse Sensors with Background Suppression</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diffuse Reflective Sensors are categorized into two main types - Normal Diffuse Sensors and Diffuse Sensors with Background Suppression. Normal Diffuse Sensors detect objects based on the reflection of light off the object back to the sensor. Diffuse Sensors with Background Suppression, on the other hand, are designed to ignore background objects and only detect the presence of objects within a specific range. Both types of sensors have their own unique applications and advantages in industrial automation and robotics.</p></p>
