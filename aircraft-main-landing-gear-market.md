<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Main Landing Gear Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rocker Landing Gear</li><li>Pontoon Landing Gear</li><li>Framed Landing Gear</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft Main Landing Gear can be classified into three types - Rocker Landing Gear, Pontoon Landing Gear, and Framed Landing Gear. Rocker Landing Gear reduces shock on landing by using a rocking motion to absorb impact. Pontoon Landing Gear is commonly used on seaplanes, providing buoyancy when landing on water. Framed Landing Gear consists of a strong frame structure to support the weight of the aircraft during landing. Each type of landing gear is designed to suit specific landing conditions and aircraft requirements.</p></p>
