<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Forging Presses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Hydraulic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Forging presses come in two main types: mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical forging presses operate using mechanical energy to apply pressure and force on the material being forged. These presses are generally more cost-effective and suitable for lighter-duty applications. On the other hand, hydraulic forging presses use hydraulic energy to generate pressure, making them more powerful and suitable for heavy-duty forging tasks. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various industries depending on the specific requirements of the forging process.</p></p>
