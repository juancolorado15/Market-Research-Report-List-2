<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Propeller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Controllable Pitch Propeller</li><li>Fixed Pitch Propeller</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Marine Propeller market consists of two main types: Controllable Pitch Propellers (CPP) and Fixed Pitch Propellers (FPP). Controllable Pitch Propellers allow for the angle of the blades to be adjusted while the vessel is in operation, providing greater efficiency and maneuverability. Fixed Pitch Propellers, on the other hand, have blades with a fixed angle, making them simpler and more cost-effective. Both types of propellers are widely used in various marine vessels, each offering distinct advantages depending on specific operational requirements.</p></p>
