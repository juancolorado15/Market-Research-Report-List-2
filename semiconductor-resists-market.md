<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Resist</li><li>Negative Resist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductor resists play a crucial role in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices by serving as a pattern for the etching process. There are two main types of semiconductor resists: positive resist and negative resist. Positive resist is sensitive to UV light and becomes more soluble in the areas exposed to light, while negative resist becomes less soluble in the areas exposed to light. Positive resist is used when the desired pattern is the exposed portion, while negative resist is used when the desired pattern is the unexposed portion.</p></p>
